INTRODUCTION.

*ᾐ-

Tun object of the present volume isto shew more
completely the precise points of differeuce between the
Chronicles of Wendover aud Paris, by furuishiug the
· re'ader with the additions aud various readings made by
the latter historiau to the work ol the former, aud so
rendering the history more perfect, by combiuiug the
labours oi both writers, so far as they are the narrators

· of contemporaneous events. Iu doing this, it was the
original intention oi the editor to include also a col· ’

latiou of the Historia Minor; but the perusal of the first
few peges oi that work, appended to this Introduction,
will be sufficient, it is hoped, to shew that such au
attempt, however desirahle, was altogether impraeti·
cable. The different style of lauguage used iu relatiug
the same events as are recorded iu the Greater Chronicle,
the additional matter also with which it is supplied,
would have made it necessary to priut volumes iu order
to render such a collation at all perfect. It does, iu·
deed, seem extraordinary that such a collatiou should
never have been made3 still more so, perhaps, that the
work itself never should have heeu printed, being, as
it is, so entirely throughout the original work of Mat·
thew Paris, aud existiug, as at the present day, in the
original handwriting of its ingenious aud learned com·
piler.¹ Iu former timae, however, men appear to have
rested equally well satisfied with the Historia Major3
