writing of Paris himself. That it was the first tran·
script would appear evident from the fact, that those
which appear as marginal variatione in this are in the
Cotton manuscript embodied in the text3 at the same
time that a few passages occurring in it, which are not
found in the other, might justify us in the belief that
they were ,both executed in the liletime of Paris him-
self.

From the foregoing statement therefore it would ap-
pear, that we have from a comparison of these manu-⁴
scripts the complete history of the labours of Matthew
Paris We have, in the first place, the text of his
predecessor left almost in its original state, so much
so indeed as not even to need a fresh transcript of

· the Chronicle, since the margin and ‘a lew interpolated

· leaves are sufficient for the purpose. In the next place,
we have from the year 1189 a fresh transcript, or rather
new volume, called for by the additional matter to be
inserted and corrections to be made; again, this having
been corrected with dne care, still by the author himself,
we have the more perfect form, as sarasan uninter·
rupted text can make it so, in the complete transcript
as afforded ns by the Cotton manuscript; and beyond all
this we have Paris’ very autograph abridyrwot¹ of, or
compilation from, the whole, as exhibited in the His·
toria Minor, now preserved in the old Royal Collection
of MSS. in the British Musenm.

Supposing, however, the point to be established that
Paris did not write all, but only so much of the
Chronicle that bears his name, it may yet be asked,

himself the word ‘offendiculum’ or curate collation, into the Historia
‘Utile eod impertinene‘ ud historiam Minor.
