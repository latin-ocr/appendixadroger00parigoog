how is it proved that Wendover wrote the remainderi
For an answer to this question the reader is referred
to the Preface of this edition, where, in addition to the
arguments adduced in his behalf, may be added further
the mode of dividing the work, as it is recognized in
the compiler's prologue, as also the tacit acknow-
ledgment of Paris himself, in suffering to be inserted
on the'margin of his new volume,¹ at thetime when
Wendover terminated his labours, the note following,
‘Huc usque scripsit cronica dominus Rogerns de Wen-
dovre,’ etc.

In preparing the present volume, the Editor has been
careful to preserve every important variation with which

' an accurate collation of the text with Wats' edition of
Matthew Paris and the Variantes Lectiones of that editor ·

could furnish him. He has also, in any doubtful case,
sought assistance from the MSS. to which allusion has
been before made. At the same time that he has not
thought it necessary to preserve every trifling deviation
from the original, which, although highly important in
many cases in editing the classical writers of Rome and
, Greece, can yet be but of little real value inan his-
torian writing at a period when elegance of style was,
comparatively speaking, little cultivated. The varia-
tions to which allusion rs here made are such as the

, reading marcelli cr t'for eo perpetuum, siem for prout, io

supera cataros for reliquos aa satyromata, alternating very ·
much on the side of either historian. The additions,
however, are everywhere introduced, and any marked
difference of style preserved. The following introduc-
tory chapters of the Historia Minor are here appended,
in order to convey to the reader some idea of the mode
adopted by Paris in the composition of that highly
interesting Chroniole.
