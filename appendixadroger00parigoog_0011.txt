since, with the exception of the Cecil MS. erroneously
stated “ by Wats as being deposited in the C.C.C.
Library, Cambridge, no other copy of the Historia
Minor is known to have existed. That the Cecil MS.
did contain the lesser chronicle is clear from the various
readings given¹ by Wats at the end of the printed edi·
tions os Paria, ‚all differing much from the present re·
ceived text, and agreeing verbatim with the Royal MS.
Interesting, however, as this manuscript is on its own
account, it becomes even more valuable from tbe light
which, as the autograph of Paris, it throws upon the
question os the authenticity of Weudover's history.
From a comparison of it with the Cambridge manu-
script, the innovatione, whether by correction or ad-
dition, of Mattbew Paris may be ascertained with the
most minute accuracy3 for in tbe first volume os the
latter MS, extending to the year 1189,l the additions
sometimes ou the margin, at others by insertion of new
leaves, at others again by erasures written over, are all
by precisely the same hand. The volume spoken of
appears, iu fact, to be the very copy of Weudover’s
Chronicle, or the Great Chronicles of St. Albau’s, used
by Paris as the foundation of his Historia Maj0r‚-
tbe ‘ copy' as it were srom which his amended text was
to be transcribed. The second volume is by altogether
a different and a somewhat later hand. The text is
no longer Weudover’s, but, as it would seem, the tran-
scriptos Paris' “ first edition’ of that chronicler, and it
is remarkable that it is apparently iu tbe same band·
writing with that of the Cotton MS. in the British
Musenm. Still, the textos Weudover is not altogether
lest, and additions and erasures continue iu the hand-

ιΑἱ the end of the year 1188, in usque ad annum Domini bic notatum3'
the MS. of the Historia Minor, occurs where allusion is evidently made to
the following note on the margin, the Cambridge MS, as is probably
‘Hac est vera contractio historie Ma· intended also in ὼε marginal note at
thei Parisiensis in primo volumine, in ibe same point of time in tbe MS. of
qno habetur historia ab origine mundi Weudover.
